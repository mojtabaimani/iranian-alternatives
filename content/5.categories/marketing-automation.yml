title: Marketing Automation
description: Marketing automation software enables businesses to set up automatic responses based on user actions and data. The tools use workflows - created through user-friendly drag-and-drop editors - to define when and how to communicate with customers through various channels like email, chat, or app notifications. For example, a workflow might remind shoppers about items left in their cart or reach out to new registrants who haven't made purchases. These systems integrate with other business tools like CRM and email platforms to access the user data needed to trigger appropriate automated responses.
