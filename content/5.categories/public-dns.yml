title: Public DNS Resolvers
description: When users visit a website, their device contacts a public DNS resolver (also called a recursive DNS server) to find the website's IP address. While internet service providers offer DNS servers, many users choose specialized public DNS resolvers that offer better speed and security than their ISP's default servers.
